Appendix A Emacs 29 Antinews
****************************

For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 29.4.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many
Emacs {No value for 'EMACSVER'} features.

   • Emacs can no longer be built for Android mobile devices.  We have
     removed the Android support because it was deemed unnecessary, what
     with the screens of the mobile devices becoming smaller and smaller
     as you move back in time.  We expect Android users to enjoy the
     much simpler text editors available on their devices.  As a nice
     bonus, removing Android support allowed us to get rid of gobs of
     related files, thus making the release tarballs much leaner.

   • We have deleted much of the enhanced support for touchscreen
     devices, for the same reason we dropped Android: there will be no
     need for that as you move back in time.

   • We also dropped support for sophisticated input methods that
     include text conversions, again because those are mostly needed on
     mobile and hand-held devices, which we gradually remove from Emacs
     in each past version.

   • Like its newer releases, Emacs 29 can still be built with support
     of native compilation of Lisp programs.  However, in preparation
     for removal of this feature in some previous version, we've made
     the native compiler support off by default; you will now have to
     request it explicitly at configure time.  This makes the default
     Emacs build process much faster.

   • JSON interfaces slowly move into oblivion as past years come
     closer, so we have removed our internal implementation of JSON; you
     will now need to build Emacs with the libjansson library, if you
     need JSON. Eventually, we plan on removing JSON support from Emacs
     altogether; this move will make the removal much simpler.

   • Tree-sitter based modes are now completely independent of their
     non-Tree-Sitter counterparts.  We decided that keeping the settings
     separate and independent goes a long way toward simplicity, which
     is one of our main motivations for removing stuff from Emacs.

   • Various Help commands no longer turn on Outline minor mode.  With
     less material to display in the *Help* buffers, due to removing of
     excess documentation from Emacs, we think using outlining is an
     unnecessary complication, as scrolling through plain text is so
     much simpler.

     For the same reasons, Emacs no longer shows Unicode names of
     characters in *Help* buffers shown by ‘describe-bindings’.

   • To make Emacs configuration simpler and easier to control, the tool
     bar can now be displayed only in its natural and logical position:
     on the top of the frame; no more of that ‘tool-bar-position’
     nonsense with tool bars on the bottom.  For the same reasons
     ‘modifier-bar-mode’ is now gone.

   • The command ‘recover-file’ no longer lets you display the diffs
     between a file and its auto-save file.  You either want to recover
     a file or you don't; confusing users with a third alternative when
     they are anxious already by the possibility of losing precious
     edits is considered a bad idea, certainly so as we move further
     towards smaller, simpler Emacs.

   • Several languages and input methods, which will fall in disuse as
     you move back in time, were removed.  This includes Urdu, Pashto,
     and Sindhi languages, and the input method for the Colemak keyboard
     layout.  Many ‘C-x 8’ key sequences, including those which insert
     various quotation characters and guillemets, were deleted for the
     same reason.

   • The support for ‘lzip’-compressed Info manuals was removed from the
     Info mode.  We anticipate that ‘lzip’ will disappear from the face
     of the Earth in the near past, and are preparing Emacs for that in
     advance.

   • Support for LLDB in Grand Unified Debugger mode was dropped.  We
     decided that given LLDB's diminishing popularity, its support is
     just code bloat.

   • Several fancy Project and VC commands were deleted, as part of our
     consistent effort of making Emacs simpler to use.

   • The user option ‘shell-command-guess-functions’ and the context
     menu ‘Open With’ in Dired are gone.  We trust Emacs users to always
     know themselves which shell command is the appropriate one for a
     given file, so no guessing by Dired is needed, or welcome.  The
     ‘dired-do-open’ command was deleted for the same reasons.

   • We went back to the original lean-and-mean interface for specifying
     registers for register-related commands.  The fancy preview and the
     options to go with it were deemed gratuitous and were removed.

   • Eshell is now much smaller and easier to use, due to dropping quite
     a few of the new commands and fancy new options.

   • The command ‘customize-dirlocals’ was removed.  Editing the
     ‘.dir-locals.el’ files as plain text is so much simpler, and quite
     enough.

   • We have removed several packages that we consider unnecessary for
     the past of Emacs.  This includes EditorConfig support,
     ‘which-key’, PEG, and Window-Tool-Bar.

   • The ‘etags-regen-mode’ was deleted.  Regeneration of ‘TAGS’ tables
     manually is all Emacs users will need in the past.

   • To keep up with decreasing computer memory capacity and disk space,
     many other functions and files have been eliminated in Emacs 29.4.
