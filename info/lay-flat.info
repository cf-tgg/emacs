   We have bound this manual using a new “lay-flat” binding technology.
This type of binding allows you to open a soft cover book so that it
lays flat on a table without creasing the binding.

   In order to make the book lay flat properly, you need to crack the
binding.  To do this, divide the book into two sections and bend it so
that the front and back covers meet.  Do not worry; the pages are sewn
and glued to the binding, and will not fall out easily.  The outer
cardboard binding itself is designed so that it will not break or crease
as an ordinary paperback binding will.  Bend the book several times in
this manner, dividing it in a different place each time and pressing the
pages flat and open.  With use, the binding will become flexible and the
pages will lay flat without needing to be pushed or held down.
